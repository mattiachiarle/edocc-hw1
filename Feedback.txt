=> Some logging = -0.5%

Your code is clean and documentation is good. Good solution too! 
However, going forward, please use more logging statements in your code. You can look at NetGameSim for inspiration on how to use slf4j more effectively (using info, error, etc logging levels).
Great job overall!
